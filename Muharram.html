<p style="font-size:18">Muharram is one of the important festivals for the Muslim, next to Ramzan. Allah himself has persuaded 4 months in the Islamic calendar as sacred months, in the Quran. Like the other calendars in practice, Islamism has its own calendar. The months of Islam are named their own way. Among the months of Islam, Muharram and Ramzan are considered the most auspicious ones. This year, Muharram starts on October 13 and ends on November 12.</p>
<p style="font-size:18">Muharram, basically, is observed as the first month of the Islamic Calendar. Meaning Forbidden, Muharram is considered as a month where the Sunni Muslims need to fast as they do for Ramzan. The 10th day of Muharram is considered as the holiest day of the month. The tenth day is called the “Day of Ashura”. Sunni Muslims believe they are supposed to fast and pray on the 9th and 10th day of Muharram.</p>
<p style="font-size:18">Shia Muslims read a book named Ziyarat Ashura on the Day of Ashura. They believe that Hussein Ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad, was killed in this month. On this day, Shia Muslims avoid doing all cheerful things and mourn for him with great respect.</p>
